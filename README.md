# nlp-sandbox

Developing a continuous benchmarking envrionment for NLP de-id methods.

## Project vision and values

The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has enabled secondary use of EHR data for clinical research and healthcare delivery. As much of the detailed patient information is recorded in clinical narratives, unlocking information from clinical narratives and integrating such information with structured EHR data become critical for EHR-based studies. 
PHI information in clinical narratives becomes a barrier in conducting EHR-based clinical research and sharing the research data across sites.

## Vision

- Create a cloud-based environment that enables the systematic validation of text analytics tools to solve specific tasks (i.e. the “NLP Sandbox”). 
- Populate the “NLP Sandbox” with appropriate reference data sets to be used in shared validation tasks.
- Engages CTSA hubs to contribute tools and methods to the project and demonstrate their performance, reproducibility, and rigor in such a shared environment
